 ********************* Internal Structure *********************
 *
 * The LCD contains two 8-bit register (Instruction register for storing the instruction) and (Data register that sores the data income )
 * Character Generator ROM CGROM contain the 208 charcters 5 * 8 dot font and 32 characters 5 * 10 dot font 
 * Character Display RAM  DDRAM (In the character Generate RAM the user can rewrite the new character by programing )
 *
 ***************** Operating Mode *****************************
 *
 * The LCD can be operated by two operating mode 
 * 8-bit operating mode   (all eight bus line from DB0 to DB7 are used )
 * 4-bit operating mode  (only used buses from DB4 to DB7 the other remain idle)
 *
 **************** Pin Out Function ***************************
 *
 *                  * Control Pins *
 *  RS            Select 0 for instruction register, 1 for data register 
 *  R/W           Select 0  for write the data from the Mc to LCD and 1 to Read the Data
 *  E             Start Data read or write (Transaction from High to Low Write Mode , Transaction from Low to High Read Mode )
 * 
 *                * Data Pins *
 *  DB0 to DB3    Four lower order bidirectional pins. Used to transmit or receive data between the Mc and the LCD
 *  DB4 to DB7    Four Higher order bidirectional pins. Used to transmit or receive data between the Mc and the LCD
 *  DB7            Can be Used as reflect the state of the Busy Flag BF
 *
 *                * Power Pins *
 *  VSS          Power Supply Pin Should Be Connected To The Ground 
 *  VDD          Power Supply pin Should Be Connected To The Vcc (3.3 ~ 9 )Volt
 *  VO           Power Supply Pin Control The LCD Construct Should Connect To The Variable PullDown Resistance
 *  A            The Anode Terminal of The Back LCD  (Should Be Driven High 3.3V)
 *  K            The Cathode Terminal of The back LCD (GND)  
 *
 ***************** Function Discreption ***********************
 * Busy Flag When The BF is 1 The LCD is Busy Can not Take instruction You Can Check The Busy Flag When The RS = 0, RW = 1 @DB7
 *
 *								Operation Selection
 *				RS				R/W				Operation
 *				0				0			    IR write as an internal operation (display clear, etc.)
 *				0				1				Read busy flag (DB7) and address counter (DB0 to DB6)
 *				1				0				Write To LCD
 *				1				1				Read The Contents of The LCD
 * 
 ******************************** Instructions ************************************
 *
 *	Clear display							Clears entire display and sets DDRAM address 0 in address counter.
 *	Return home				 (1.52ms)		Sets DDRAM address 0 in address counter. Also returns display from being shifted to original position DDRAM contents remain unchanged.
 *	Entry mode set			 (37 us )		Sets cursor move direction	and specifies display shift.
 *	Display on/off control	 (37 us )		Controls LCD , Cursor , Blinking.
 *  Cursor or display shift	 (37 us )		shifts LCD without changing it's Content.
 *  Function set			 (37 us )		Sets interface data length (DL),number of display lines(N),and character font (F).
 *	Read busy flag & address (0 us )	    Reads busy flag (BF)
 *	Set DDRAM address		 (37 us )
 *	Set CGRAM address		 (37 us )
